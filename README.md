# comparing a machine learning techniques on quantum computing an d classical computing 
analysisng and Comparision on various quantum computing , machine learning classifiers like QCNN,QSVM,VQC and classicial  computing classifiers like SVM,CNN,Random forest ,decision tree. analysisng the accuracy of each classier and predicting the malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous).
